    "Bottom line is: notebooks allow to approach data analysis in a very organic and playful way. Most of the time, this will lead to unintersting clues, but in a few occasions, it may result in a very interesting fact that will lead to a whole new range of questions and hypotheses. Exploratory data analysis encourages quick plotting of a wide range of data views, in order to better appreciate the \"texture\" of the underlying data, spot anomalies (useful for data cleaning), spot outliers and interesting facts (to dig further), and form hypotheses to later be confirmed using statistical methods."
