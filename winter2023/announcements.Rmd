<!-- ### __Feb 23rd, 2021__ -->

<!-- Although this is late notice, we wanted to let you know that the JSC370 class has another guest lecture: -->

<!-- __Speaker__: Wanying Zhao, Ontario Trillium Foundation -->

<!-- __Topic__: Measuring the impact of charitable intervations -->

<!-- __Date/Time__: Feb 23rd, 2021, 3:10-4:00pm EST -->

<!-- __Zoom Info__: https://utoronto.zoom.us/j/89713225921 -->

<!-- We hope to see you there. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ### __Feb 20th, 2021__ -->

<!-- Join us for the February installment of the Data Science Speaker Series at U of T. -->

<!-- Speaker: -->

<!-- Dr. Tom Wright, -->

<!-- Research Scientist, Kensington Vision Research Centre -->

<!-- Assistant Professor, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, University of Toronto -->

<!-- Talk Title: __From mosquitos to flying saucers: Modelling in an imperfect world__ -->

<!-- Date & Time: Monday, Feb 22, 2021 | 5:15-6:15 pm ET -->

<!-- Location: Online -->

<!-- Free Event | All Welcome | [Register Here](https://canssiontario.utoronto.ca/event/dsss_tom-wright/) -->

<!-- __Abstract:__ -->

<!-- Modern technologies for measuring the function of the in-vivo visual system produce a wealth of data which is not completely understood. Current analysis techniques are often subjective, relying on interpretation by trained specialists and often rely on information reduction to enable the use of traditional inferential statistics. Using the example of Hydroxychloroquine, a newly (in) famous disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), we will examine the problems and advantages of applying machine learning to the interpretation of medical tests. -->

<!-- __Profile:__ -->

<!-- Dr. Wright is an assistant professor in the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto. He established the only visual electrophysiology diagnostic service providing routine adult testing in Southern Ontario. His research interests involve using visual electrophysiology and high resolution retinal imaging to describe the phenotypic effects of disease and other insults on the human visual system. By applying a partial least squares analysis, originally developed for fMRI analysis, to the multifocal Electroretinogram he identified deficits in the retinal function of adolescents with Type 1 diabetes before the onset of clinical retinopathy. His recent work has focused on describing retinal phenotypes of patients with inherited retinal disease. -->
