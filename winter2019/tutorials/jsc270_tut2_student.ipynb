    "\n",
    "- Answer the questions in the cells that indicate where your answers should be placed. Leave the initial comment in the code cell and heading (indicated by `# Answer for qustion XX`).  For example, place your code for Question 1 in the code cell with comment `# Enter your answer for Question 1 into this cell` (remember not to delete this comment).\n",

    "\n",
    "- A *Jupyter notebook* using Python that contains all the data analyses. Make sure to comment your code in the code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additional files that your notebook requires to compile properly (e.g. a data file).\n",

    "### When should it be submitted?\n",
    "\n",
    "*This tutorial consists of a 2-step submission as follows:*\n",

    "- **At the end of the tutorial (in-lab tutorial assignment)**: Commit and push your notebook to the Github classroom repository that contains your answers (i.e., the file named: jsc270_tut2_answers_lastname_studentnumber.ipynb) before 14:10 on the day of the tutorial, January 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In between January 23, 14:10 p.m. and January 28, 11:30 you should commit and push your answer notebook as you work on the assignment during the week. Commiting and pushing often is good practice (and as a bonus you will have a backup and be able to revisit previous version).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`nbdime`](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python package that allows you (and the teaching team) to the changes you have made to your assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Homework (tutorial assignment completion)**: Push your completed tutorial by 11:30, Monday, January 28.  Your last commit closest to 11:30 will be considered your final assignment.\n",
